The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">AKM</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">The AKM is an assault rifle type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. The AKM (Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanny, lit. Modernized Kalashnikov Automatic Rifle) is an improved version of the original AK-47 first developed in 1959, featuring improvements and refinements in manufacturing and materials to create a modernized version of one of the most recognizable firearms in the world. Especially popular with freedom fighters, insurgents, and guerrilla forces, in BATTLEGROUNDS its stopping power makes it popular for close-quarters combat.A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match. In regards to attachments, the AKM is identical to the M16A4 in that it can only accept a muzzle, magazine, and sight attachment. It is best used in single-shot mode except when attempting to breach buildings with it.

        At close to medium ranges, it is notable in that even if a target is wearing a military vest and/or Spetsnaz helmet, it only takes a maximum of five shots to kill. It is also capable of killing a Spetsnaz helmet wearer in two shots by landing a shot on the head, then finishing them off with another shot to any other part of their body.
        
        The AKM will deal maximum damage within 50 meters, beyond that distance damage will continually decrease out to 290 meters. Thus, it is not recommended to engage sufficiently armored players at longer ranges as the recoil and lower bullet velocity compared to other rifles will prove landing consistent hits difficult.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">Beryl M762</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">The Beryl M762 is an assault rifle type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. While its outward appearance would imply it being a direct variation of an AK/RPK-pattern rifle, it is actually an export variant of the FB Beryl, with its name bearing the 7.62mm caliber it is chambered for.

        This weapon was introduced in the Test Server PC 1.0 update #20.The Beryl M762 is a versatile assault rifle with more attachment points than the AKM, on par with the SCAR-L. Its base damage per shot is slightly lower than the other 7.62mm assault rifles, offset by its rate of fire being almost as fast as that of the Groza, allowing its overall damage per second to be significantly higher than the comparable AKM. This comes at the cost of significantly higher recoil that — unlike the AKM — can be reduced by attaching foregrips.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">SCAR-L</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">The SCAR-L is a relatively stable assault rifle, with a rate of fire that, together with its moderately low recoil, allows it to be easy to control. With a vertical grip and compensator the rifle can comfortably be used on full auto even with a 4x scope. The most noticeable drawback is its restrictive iron sights, so finding a reflex sight or scope should be a priority when finding this weapon. It also has the slowest bullet speed of the 5.56mm rifles, although this is still much faster than the 7.62mm rifles. The slow bullet speed and relatively mediocre stats of this gun are compensated by the fact that this gun has the furthest minimum damage falloff distance of all the non-crate assault rifles and that gunfire from this weapon is quieter compared to the other assault rifles.

        The SCAR-L will deal maximum damage out to 70 meters, reaching its minimum at 495 meters.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">AWM</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">The AWM is a powerful bolt action rifle designed for extreme range sharpshooting. Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in the game, it is also one of only two ranged weapons (the other being the crossbow) capable of killing any player in one shot to the head, even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet. At distances beyond 500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill players in one shot to the head. The long reload, time between shots, high damage and unique ammo all represent the high risk, high reward gameplay that requires the user to have patience and a steady aim, moving position quickly after firing, lest other players recognizing the firing sound of the AWM attempt to close in to take the weapon for themselves.

        The AWM will deal maximum damage out to 150 meters, with maximum damage falloff at 679 meters.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">M24</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">The M24 can be seen as another option after the Kar98k, with lower damage but higher muzzle velocity, it has slightly more deviation when not aiming down the sights. Being loaded via magazines, tactical reloads will be faster compared to the Kar98k's one-by-one reload, although full reloads with the M24's standard magazine will be slightly slower compared to a full reload with the Kar98k. Nevertheless, the M24 is a valuable weapon that should be prioritized for its ability to deal large amounts of damage at great distances.

        The M24 will deal maximum damage out to 120 meters. Beyond that distance, damage will decrease, reaching its minimum damage value at 580 meters.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">Groza</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">Dealing the same damage as the AKM and boasting the second-highest rate of fire of all assault rifles, only bested by the M16A4, it can turn the tables around for whoever is lucky enough to get their hands on this rare weapon, particularly in the final stages of the match.

        While this weapon could be deemed overpowered, it has one major drawback: an abysmal reload time of 3 seconds when performing a dry reload. It is therefore advised to not empty the entire magazine, however its rate of fire in a firefight may make this rather difficult, so the next best option would be checking that the area around is secure enough to warrant a fresh magazine in the gun. Quickdraw magazines can also help mitigate the long reload time. Other drawbacks are its inability to accept foregrips of any kind, or any telescopic sights stronger than a 6x scope, reinforcing its use as a close-quarters weapon. Backing this up is the fact that the only muzzle attachment it can take is a suppressor.
        
        These flaws only serve to represent the power of the Groza, and it is therefore advised to prioritise players using this weapon, especially when there are less than 10 players alive. The long reload time can be seen as an opportunity to move in for the kill, provided that the target doesn't have a backup weapon such as a Saiga-12K.
        
        The Groza will deal maximum damage out to 80 meters, decreasing to its minimum at 490 meters.</p>
    <h2 style="color:navy">M416</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke">Compared to the other 5.56mm assault rifles, in its unmodified state the M416 is fairly similar to the others besides its slightly faster rate of fire compared to the SCAR-L, however its strong points are the fact that it can accept the most modifications of any of the assault rifles, accepting muzzle, magazine, stock, lower and upper rail attachments, as well has having exceptional stability, only bested by the AUG. A fully modified M416 is therefore highly sought after as its very low recoil allows for controllable fully automatic fire, even with a 4x ACOG Scope attached.

        The M416 will deal maximum damage out to 60 meters, with damage reaching a minimum at 445 meters.</p>
